"""Freighter component palette."""

# TBD: Design of the palette
# Simple grid layout with every component, analogous to a color palette? (meh)
# Ideally grouped in some way: sections or as cascading buttons
#   - Sections acting as clusters
#   - Cascading buttons that expand into relevant, more specific components i.e.
#     one for corridor pieces, another for rooms, etc.
#   - Mimic the in-game structure of the components in the GUI?
